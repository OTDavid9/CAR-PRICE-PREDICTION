The autos.csv dataset is a comprehensive repository of valuable information about pre-owned automobiles. It offers insights into the vehicles' sales details, selling prices, and their overall condition. Each listing includes data such as the date the ad was first seen (dateCrawled), car name, seller type (private or dealer), offer type, price, A/B testing information, vehicle type, year of registration (indicating the car's initial registration year), gearbox type, power output in PS (horsepower), car model, total mileage, month of registration (providing insight into the car's age), fuel type (whether it uses petrol, diesel, electricity, LPG, etc.), brand name, and information about unrepaired damage if applicable. DateCreated informs us about when the specific advertisement was created on platforms like eBay. The nrofpictures field offers an estimate of how many images are included with each ad, and postalcode contains information about the area code where the car is listed. Lastly, lastseen provides an estimate of the last time a web crawler scanned the particular online posting. All these data points play a crucial role in determining the appropriate price for used vehicles. Furthermore, this dataset allows for regression analysis, which can be based on average prices across different years. So, prepare your laptop because this dataset is a valuable resource for analyzing used car prices.
